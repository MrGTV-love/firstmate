# --- the wedge threshold reads the crew's own parked-gate state --------------
# Upstream kunchenguid/firstmate#3055: a lane parked at a validation gate that is
# waiting on a HUMAN is correctly quiet, but nothing in the status LINE says so -
# the evidence is the pipeline's gate state, not anything the worker wrote. One
# such lane reached 671 consecutive escalations on a single home. Neither landed
# mitigation covers it: a declared `paused:` does nothing because a live ordinary
# crewmate's absorb class never reads paused, and raising the threshold delays
# genuine wedge detection for every lane equally.
#
# The distinction that makes this safe is between the two gates the crew state
# both reports as `parked`: one owed a HUMAN, and one owed the CREWMATE's own
# answer. Only the first may go quiet - a crewmate that wedges before answering
# its own gate is exactly the failure this ladder exists to catch - so both
# directions are pinned here, and the crewmate direction is written so that a
# consumer which merely searched the verdict for the token would fail it.
# The second half of that evidence - that the human was actually asked and has
# not answered - is pinned in the test below this one.

# the decision with `axi respond`. So a lane that is quiet because the crewmate
# wedged before relaying an answer it already has would read exactly like a lane
# waiting on firstmate - and would lose the ladder for the one failure the
# ladder exists to catch.
# The task's own decision fold is the record that closes that hole, because it is
# written at ANSWER time rather than at relay time: `fm-send --resolve-key`
# appends the closing `resolved` line the moment the decision is answered. An open
# `needs-decision` therefore means the human was told and has not answered; its

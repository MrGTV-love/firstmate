# shellcheck disable=SC2034 # TEARDOWN_FOREIGN_* are output globals for bin/fm-teardown.sh.
# Foreign nested copies in the pool slot a teardown returns, and the task's own
# nested copies that Vernant's creation lock holds.
#
# A foreign copy is a registered worktree strictly inside the slot that no
# record of the retiring task names. Vernant's start_task_worktree.py creates
# one at <slot>/.claude/worktrees/<name> and locks it with
# "vernant-session-active owner=launcher:<pid> launcher=<pid>"; nothing else
# ever releases that lock, so the slot could never be returned. This library
# proves such a copy is nobody's and landed, then releases and removes it.
# bin/fm-teardown.sh's header owns the rule; this file owns the mechanics.
#
# A copy is released only when every proof holds, and each proof fails closed:
#   - it is a clean worktree root, and each ignored file it holds is either
#     regenerable machinery (listed in teardown_preservable_ignored) or copied
#     with its SHA-256 into $DATA/$ID/nested-copy-preserved before removal; a
#     foreign copy that holds any other ignored file is held, below, instead of
#     released wherever the hold applies (teardown_foreign_copy_hold_applies),
#     and is preserved and released as above wherever it does not;
#   - no other active task record names it, no process outside this teardown's
#     own runs in it, and no live process outside this teardown's own is its
#     lock launcher (a process is this teardown's own when it, or an ancestor by
#     parent chain, has a cwd exactly at a root retire sweeps, and a pid that
#     started after the lock file was written is recycled and owns nothing). The
#     retire phase sends TERM to each such launcher and each such process running
#     in the copy, waits a bounded time, and sends no KILL; one still alive
#     refuses the release, named by its pid. A process that is not this
#     teardown's own is never signalled and refuses at once, named by its pid;
#   - its work is landed by the existing landed-work rule (teardown_landed).
# A copy whose work is not proved landed stays, and teardown names why.
# One refusal class does not stop the task's own closure. A copy that is clean,
# owned by no record, process or live launcher, and held back only by ignored
# files that exist nowhere else or by a HEAD that is not proved landed is HELD:
# when every refused copy in the slot is of that class and the task's own copy
# already passed the landed-work proof, bin/fm-teardown.sh closes the task and
# reserves the slot under a durable lease, defers its return and leaves every
# foreign copy exactly as it was (teardown_held_copies_record appends each one to
# data/held-foreign-copies.log before anything is removed). Nothing here ever
# removes or alters a held copy, and --force never holds one.
# The task's own nested copies (the record's worktree= and prior_worktree= copies
# inside the slot) were already proved clean and landed or anchored by the
# caller. One of them that Vernant's creation lock holds is released the same
# way, never by forcing the removal: its ignored files are preserved as above,
# no process outside this teardown may run in it or be its live lock launcher,
# and no other active record may name it; the driver then verifies the landing
# again and refuses what it cannot prove. An own copy that is not locked is
# removed as before.
# A copy locked by Vernant's creation lock is released and removed by Vernant's
# own driver (closeout_pr.py --cleanup-worktree <copy> --execute-cleanup, run
# from the slot with FM_TEARDOWN_VERNANT_PYTHON or <slot>/.venv/bin/python). An
# unlocked copy is removed with a plain non-forced git worktree remove. A lock in
# any other format, a driver refusal, or a copy still registered afterwards
# refuses. Removal deletes the copy's checkout and the allow-listed ignored files
# in it (symlinks, virtual environments, node_modules and tool caches,
# .DS_Store, Firstmate's hook files, regenerable build caches, and anything
# ignored under its .claude and .opencode trees); it loses no commit, because
# the work is landed, and no tracked change, because the clean proof refuses one.
# Any other ignored entry is copied to the task's data directory before removal.
# The clean proof skips
# untracked files under .claude only; the ignored-file proof skips ignored files
# under .claude and .opencode; plain git worktree remove still refuses a copy
# that holds an untracked file. On the pool-slot route the release runs before
# the final project-lock wait, so the driver never runs while the lock is held,
# except when teardown keeps project custody through the return.
#
# Requires bin/fm-task-copy-lib.sh, bin/fm-lock-lib.sh and bin/fm-refuse-lib.sh first,
# and runs inside bin/fm-teardown.sh, whose globals (PROJ, ID, DATA, META,
# STATE, WT, TASK_TMP, FORCE, KIND, LEGACY_RECORD_GIVEN, TEARDOWN_NESTED_COPIES,
# TEARDOWN_RETURN_SLOT, TEARDOWN_PEER_SLOT, TEARDOWN_HELD_SLOT) and functions
# (teardown_landed, pids_with_cwd_under, task_process_identity,
# task_process_identity_matches, task_record_process_signal) it uses.
# bin/fm-copy-sweep.sh also calls teardown_preserve_ignored, with DATA set to its
# data directory and ID to a per-release id, and teardown_run_closeout, for a
# locked copy it proved on its own.

# shellcheck disable=SC2034 # TEARDOWN_FOREIGN_* are output globals for bin/fm-teardown.sh.
# Foreign nested copies in the pool slot a teardown returns.
#
# A foreign copy is a registered worktree strictly inside the slot that no
# record of the retiring task names. Vernant's start_task_worktree.py creates
# one at <slot>/.claude/worktrees/<name> and locks it with
# "vernant-session-active owner=launcher:<pid> launcher=<pid>"; nothing else
# ever releases that lock, so the slot could never be returned. This library
# proves such a copy is nobody's and landed, then releases and removes it.
# bin/fm-teardown.sh's header owns the rule; this file owns the mechanics.
#
# A copy is released only when every proof holds, and each proof fails closed:
#   - it is a clean worktree root and holds no ignored file unique to it;
#   - no other active task record names it, no process outside this teardown's
#     own runs in it, and no live process outside this teardown's own is its
#     lock launcher (a process this teardown retires, or a descendant of one, is
#     not counted, and a pid that started after the lock file was written is
#     recycled and owns nothing; the retire phase signals such a process with
#     TERM when it is a launcher with its own cwd outside every swept root or a
#     process running in the copy, and one that outlives that signal and a short
#     wait refuses the release, named by its pid);
#   - its work is landed by the existing landed-work rule (teardown_landed).
# A copy whose work is not proved landed stays, and teardown names why.
# A copy locked by Vernant's creation lock is released and removed by Vernant's
# own driver (closeout_pr.py --cleanup-worktree <copy> --execute-cleanup, run
# from the slot with FM_TEARDOWN_VERNANT_PYTHON or <slot>/.venv/bin/python). An
# unlocked copy is removed with a plain non-forced git worktree remove. A lock in
# any other format, a driver refusal, or a copy still registered afterwards
# refuses. Removal deletes the copy's checkout and the allow-listed ignored files
# in it (symlinks, virtual environments, node_modules and tool caches,
# .DS_Store, Firstmate's hook files, and anything ignored under its .claude and
# .opencode trees); it loses no commit, because the work is landed, and no
# tracked change, because the clean proof refuses one. The clean proof skips
# untracked files under .claude only; the ignored-file proof skips ignored files
# under .claude and .opencode; plain git worktree remove still refuses a copy
# that holds an untracked file. On the pool-slot route the release runs before
# the final project-lock wait, so the driver never runs while the lock is held,
# except when teardown keeps project custody through the return.
#
# Requires bin/fm-task-copy-lib.sh and bin/fm-lock-lib.sh to be sourced first,
# and runs inside bin/fm-teardown.sh, whose globals (PROJ, ID, META, STATE, WT,

# (teardown_landed, pids_with_cwd_under, task_process_identity,
# task_process_identity_matches, task_record_process_signal) it uses.

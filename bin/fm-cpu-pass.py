"""
fm-cpu-pass.py - host-wide CPU pass pool for CPU-heavy test bursts.

Usage:
  fm-cpu-pass.sh run [--passes K] [--label TEXT] [--log-fd N] -- COMMAND [ARGS...]
  fm-cpu-pass.sh pipeline-start [--priority CLASS] -- COMMAND [ARGS...]
  fm-cpu-pass.sh status [--json]
  fm-cpu-pass.sh size

`run` waits for K passes from the pool, runs COMMAND while holding them, and
exits with COMMAND's status (128+n when a signal n ended it).
`status` reports how many passes are held and by whom; `size` prints the pool
size so a caller can size its own worker count (for example pytest -n).

The pool bounds CPU-heavy bursts (test suites and their workers), not agents
or sessions: interactive work never asks for a pass and is never queued.
docs/cpu-pass-pool.md owns the cross-repository protocol this command
implements: pool directory and size, slot and turnstile locks, the
FM_CPU_PASS_HELD nested marker, and degrading without a pass.
This header owns the command's own behavior below.

Waiting:
  - A waiter polls with backoff (50 ms growing to 500 ms) and never times out:
    a pass request queues, it does not fail. Time spent waiting is outside
    COMMAND, so a bound the caller places inside COMMAND (for example a
    per-script timeout) does not start until the passes are held.
  - After 2 s of waiting it writes one notice, then one every 60 s, to the log
    fd, naming the pool size and the current holders; on acquisition after a
    notice it writes the wait time.
  - K must be a positive integer no larger than size; otherwise exit 125.
  - SIGTERM or SIGHUP while waiting ends the waiter with 128+n; SIGINT with 130.

Running:
  - COMMAND runs as a child in the caller's process group, so a group signal
    reaches it directly. The holder ignores SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGHUP while
    the child runs and keeps the passes until the child exits: passes stay with
    running work and are never forwarded or doubled.
  - The child's environment gains FM_CPU_PASS_HELD=<K> (0 when degraded).
  - Nested work takes no new passes and may request at most the inherited count.
    FM_CPU_PASS_HELD must be a nonnegative decimal integer or run exits 125,
    including without Python; 0 denotes degraded work and imposes no budget.
  - Only this owner retains slot descriptors; close-on-exec/close_fds prevents
    COMMAND and its descendants retaining passes after COMMAND exits.
    Killing this owner with SIGKILL releases its slots even if work survives;
    ordinary TERM/INT/HUP still keep the owner until COMMAND ends.
    The log fd is closed; stdout and stderr carry only COMMAND's own output.
  - A degraded run (the protocol's rule 7) writes one notice to the log fd.

Pipeline starts:
  - `pipeline-start` uses this pool directory's pipeline-start.lock and locked
    priority waiter files. The start policy, formula and class order are owned
    by docs/cpu-pass-pool.md. The counted runs always come from the host's
    ~/.no-mistakes/state.sqlite, opened only with mode=ro (plus immutable=1 when
    mode=ro cannot open a stopped WAL database with no -wal file): status = 'running'
    AND ci_ready_at IS NULL AND awaiting_agent_since IS NULL. Notices go to stderr.
  - Admission is by measured memory reservations, never by load average. The
    first waiter is admitted when, as bytes, (counted + 1) x R + S fits
    B = available memory + the resident memory each counted run holds now, at
    most R per run (memory a run holds above R is not free for new starts), or
    when nothing is counted (a one-start minimum). S is the largest per-run
    peak of every recorded no-mistakes run with at least 2 readings, and R the
    75th percentile (nearest rank) of those peaks leaving out runs that are
    status-running with ci_ready_at IS NULL (not CI-ready yet, so its peak may
    still rise), read from the
    root home's .memory-calibration.json (written by fm-mem-guard.sh probe; the
    root home comes from fm_firstmate_root_home in fm-secondmate-parent-lib.sh,
    kept once resolved, and a failed walk falls back). available
    and each run's resident memory come from one fm-mem-guard.py admission_sample
    reading, re-taken at most every 2 s while waiting. With fewer than 2
    qualifying recorded runs, or no native memory facts on this platform, the
    start falls back to counted < max(1, floor(logical CPUs / 3)); a missing
    record never refuses a start and never reads as an empty host.
  - Pause-only backstop: while that reading is unreadable or reports a reason to
    defer (the same list that makes fm-mem-guard.sh admit exit 75, such as native
    pressure level 2 or higher) or fm-proc-guard.py reports a pile-up (user
    process count above its warning line) or cannot be read, no start is
    admitted. Nothing running is stopped, and waiting here only delays the start.
  - Admission is before COMMAND (including any measured execution wrapper).
    No burst passes or FM_CPU_PASS_HELD budget are assigned to pipeline starts.
  - A short start lock bridges the check-to-registration race until a new
    running run ID appears, or COMMAND returns. It does not reserve a run's
    lifetime or poll after registration; status changes release capacity.
    Participating starts serialize this handshake, not their required checks.
    A registered run whose process tree the reading cannot see yet holds no
    memory in B, so it reserves its full R in the next decision.
    Bypassing this owner or external daemon status changes cannot be made
    atomic with a read-only external database; deployment must route starts here.
  - An unreadable run database or CPU count refuses with 125 instead of
    guessing headroom. If a read fails after launch, retain the start lock until
    COMMAND returns; never stop running work because the observer lost its source.

Exit status of `run` and `pipeline-start`: COMMAND's own status; 126 when COMMAND cannot be
executed, 127 when it is not found, 125 for a usage error.
